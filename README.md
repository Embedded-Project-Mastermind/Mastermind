# Introduction
The purpose of the project is to develop a version of the game Mastermind for the MSP432 microcrontroller. It is a intuitive and funny game, where the user has to guess a sequence of colors within a certain number of attempts. Some settings for the game can be chosen wia an intuitive GUI, like the dimension of the sequence to guess, the difficulty, the number of tentatives and the presence of doubles. Then, after a summary page, the game starts and at every sequence inserted, the system tells whether each color is in the right position([X]), is in the sequence but in the wrong position([O]), and if it is not present at all ([!]). The clues given are also based on the difficulty levels, which are three. For the easiest mode, one all of these three are displayed, for the medium mode, the results are displayed as the correct number of X and O but in a quantity manner and in an order that is not associated with the colors like in the easy mode: the first displayed are the X, then O and ! for the remaining. For the difficult mode there are only X and ! and they are displayed as for the medium mode.<br><br>
The MSP432 board is used to take the input of 8 buttons setted up on an external breadboard with a very simple circuit. Each button is connected to a pin of the board and to the ground, and it corresponds to a specific color, related to the cable in our configuration.

- Description and image of how to build a working pressable button<br><br>
 ...So when the button is released the internal pull-up resistor will put the value to high, while when the button is pressed the value will be low as it is connected to the ground.

## Software Requirements
• Code Composer Studio (Link)
Code Composer Studio (CCS) is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for embedded systems, particularly for programming and debugging microcontrollers and processors. Developed by Texas Instruments, CCS supports a wide range of TI’s hardware, offering tools for writing, compiling, and testing code.
<br>

# Installation and Configuration
• Install [Code Composer Studio CCS](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/CCSTUDIO/12.8.1) version 12.8.0
## Setup IDE

After the installation of **Code Composer Studio (CCS)**, version 12.8.0
1. Open the file `ccs_setup_12.8.0.00012.exe`.
2. On the opened window, press `next` one time. Accept the agreement and press `next` again four times.
3. Then, in `Select Components` select `SimpleLink™ MSP432™ low power + performance MCUs`.
4. In `Install debug probes` leave it as it clicking `next`.
5. To conclude, press `next` until the launcher begins the download.

## Import Libraries

- How to import the necessary library to make the code work, the imports that prof told us<br><br>
The SIMPLELINK-MSP432-SDK library is needed to run the program. Download it at the following link:

[SIMPLELINK-MSP432-SDK Download](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SIMPLELINK-MSP432-SDK/3.40.01.02)
 
1. Extract `simplelink_msp432p4_sdk_3_40_01_02.zip` file.  
2. Open **Code Composer Studio (CCS)** and left-click on the **Project Folder** to select **Properties**.  
3. Select **CCS Build**.  
4. Click **ARM Compiler** and then **Include Options**.  
   - 4.1 Add `"simplelink_msp432p4_sdk_3_40_01_02/source"` directory to the `"Add dir to #include search path"` window.  
5. Click **ARM Linker** and then **File Search Path**.  
   - 5.1 Add `"simplelink_msp432p4_sdk_3_40_01_02/source/ti/devices/msp432p4xx/driverlib/ccs/msp432p4xx_driverlib.lib"` to the `"Include library file..."` window.
   - 5.2 Add `"simplelink_msp432p4_sdk_3_40_01_02/source/ti/grlib/lib/ccs/m4/grlib.a"` to the `"Include library file..."` window.

# Future Integrations

- The possible integration the project could have<br>
• Connection with an ESP32 in order to display the game on another device<br>
• Sound Emition explaining how the combination gone<br>
• Theme customization<br>
• Creating a real-time engine, that allows to stop a game and resume it, using the main memory of the Embedded system
• Extend the memory of the system allowing for tentatives (MAX of 8, because of lack of memory)
